<h1 style="color:#3CCAE6">Project</h1>


**1.This project is aimed at making your understanding about HTML crystal clear. We will try to implement as many features as possible to create a complete web page. In this task, we will create a piece of functionality for FantasyFootballLeague.com (a fictional website). The page we will focus on is the new user registration page. Feel free to refer to the material covered in this section and also any resources online. The tasks to be accomplished are discussed below along with the embedded starter code. Good luck!**
